# tuple
A tuple is an ordered, immutable collection of elements in Python, allowing you to group multiple items together into a single variable. Since tuples cannot be changed after creation, they ensure data remains stable and consistent. Their immutability makes them ideal for situations where integrity is important, such as storing fixed configurations or multi-dimensional data like coordinates. With an indexed structure, tuples are both compact and efficient, offering quick access to elements while guaranteeing they stay the same.
