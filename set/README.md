# set
A set in Python is a built-in data structure that stores an unordered collection of unique and immutable elements. Sets are ideal for removing duplicate values and performing mathematical operations like union, intersection, and difference. Unlike lists or tuples, sets do not maintain any specific order, and their elements must be hashable, meaning they are immutable types such as numbers, strings, or tuples. Sets are mutable themselves, so you can add elements using the  method or remove them using methods like remove() or discard(). Python sets also support operations like union(|) for combining sets, intersection(&) for finding common elements, difference(-) for subtracting one set from another, and symmetric_difference(^) for elements exclusive to each set. Their efficient hash table implementation makes sets a powerful tool for managing data without redundancy.
