# List
A list in Python is a versatile data structure that allows you to store multiple items in a single variable. These items can be of any data type—integers, strings, floats, or even other lists—and they are ordered, changeable, and allow duplicates.
A list in Python is a powerful and flexible data structure that can store multiple items in a single variable. It is ordered, meaning items retain their sequence, and it allows duplicates, so the same value can appear more than once. Lists are also dynamic and changeable, meaning you can add, remove, or modify elements as needed. They can contain different types of data, such as numbers, strings, or even other lists. These features make lists an essential tool for organizing and working with data in Python.
