# STRING METHODS
# str.upper() Method 
The str.upper() method in Python is used to convert all characters in a string to uppercase. It does not take any parameters and returns a new string where all the letters are converted to uppercase. The original string remains unchanged, as strings are immutable in Python. 
# str.lower() Method
The str.lower() method is used to convert all characters in the string to lowercase. Like str.upper(), it does not take any parameters and returns a new string with all the letters in lowercase, leaving the original string unchanged. 
# str.title() Method
 The str.title() method converts the first character of each word in the string to uppercase and the rest to lowercase. It also does not take any parameters and returns a new string with each word capitalized.
