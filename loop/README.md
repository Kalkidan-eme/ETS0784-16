# loop
Python has two main types of loops: the for loop, used to iterate over a sequence like lists or ranges, and the while loop, which continues as long as a condition remains true. Loops can be nested, with the inner loop running completely for each iteration of the outer loop, making them useful for multi-dimensional data or combinations. The break statement exits a loop prematurely, while continue skips the current iteration. for loops are ideal when the number of iterations is known, while while loops excel when iterations depend on a condition. Be cautious of infinite loops in while and unnecessary nesting, which can increase computational complexity. Loops make repetitive tasks efficient and versatile in programming.
