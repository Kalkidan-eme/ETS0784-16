# dictionary
a dictionary is a versatile data structure that allows you to store and manage data as key-value pairs. Each key in a dictionary must be unique and immutable, such as strings, numbers, or tuples, while the associated values can be of any data type and do not have to be unique. Dictionaries are mutable, meaning you can add, modify, or remove key-value pairs after creating them. They are unordered in nature, meaning the items are not stored in any specific sequence, though starting from Python 3.7, the insertion order of items is preserved as an implementation detail. Python dictionaries also provide efficient data retrieval since accessing a value by its key is very fast, thanks to their underlying hash table implementation. With methods like , keys(), values(), and items(), and , you can easily interact with the contents of a dictionary, while functions like get() allow you to retrieve values safely without risking errors for non-existent keys. Their flexibility and power make dictionaries a fundamental and frequently used tool in Python programming.
